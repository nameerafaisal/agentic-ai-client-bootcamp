## üèõ Architecture  

<img width="900" alt="image" src="assets/Business_Automation_Architecture.png">

## Use Case Description

The sales department of ABC Motor Corp, an automotive large player, when preparing sales proposals, they were spending a lot of time understanding the features of competing products and comparing them with their own products. ABC Motor Corp, needs an automated competitive analysis system to help their sales teams quickly identify and position their products against competitors. Traditionally, gathering competitor insights required extensive manual research, making it inefficient and prone to outdated information. Therefore, the goal of this use case is to create an AI enabled system that support the customer's competitive analysis and market research.

Your task is crawl and search the Top 3 product URLs (strictly from the automobile industry) and to analyse and compare products on the following features strictly: Range, Pricing, Acceleration, Top Speed, Interior and Safety Features If a feature is not applicable, mark it as N/A. Additionally, perform a SWOT analysis of top products (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) Present the comparison in 3 tables one for the comparison , second for the rating numerical rating (X/5) and a star rating (‚òÖ out of ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ) for each feature  and  third for the SWOT analysis. Give heading to each table . After every table give two divider.
   Instructions:
   1. When asked for competitors of the given product, make sure that you provide only the name of the products and URLs of the products below the corresponding name.
   2. The generated product URLs must be strictly from the automobile industry.
   3. Title for Table 1: Feature Comparison
   4. Title for Table 2: Rating Comparison
   5. Make sure that the Rating Comparison table has both the numerical(X/5) and star rating(‚òÖ out of ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ)
   6. The products should be the column names in all the tables.
   7. The font of the Table Title must be bold and the font size must be 40% bigger as compared to the rest of the text.
   8. Add appropriate space between each section in the table.
